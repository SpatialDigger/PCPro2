Thank you for this update, Gary! I will echo Chris that these updates look awesome; the option to view multiple point clouds that you have shown here will be very useful. The first request that comes to mind for me is a similar viewer for the meshes; Alper created a tool for this that I found very helpful for checking the volumes, but as far as I can tell it is no longer working. I will continue brainstorming about the categories you have defined in your email.
